You'll go through a lot of changes, but you will still be YOU\u2014with some important di\ufb00erences. This is one girl\u2019s story.*\r\n\r\nI am Thandi and I live in South Africa. When I turned 13 my skin changed. My back and shoulders were full of pimples and my thighs and legs had stretch marks. It was hard to be happy because I was always so aware of how bad my skin looked.\r\n\r\nI would always wear a cap to cover the pimples and blackheads on my face, especially on my forehead. I would wear long sleeves and a long skirt. Anything to cover up.\r\n\r\nI felt very depressed, because people were mean to me. Also, I believed that no guy would want to date a person with such bad skin, so I stayed at home and didn\u2019t go out much.\r\n\r\nBut things changed when I met a guy at my church. He was sweet to me and after we had been friends for a while he told me that he loved everything about me. I could not believe it!\r\n\r\nHe helped me look past what was on the outside. I know I am a good person I just got so upset about the way I looked that I forgot to love and care for my body. \r\n\r\nI have accepted the stretch marks but I have started to really look after myself more. I wash my face twice a day with soap and water. I exercise and avoid oily food. I know the pimples will clear up eventually. \r\n\r\nI used to cry every day because people were so mean about the way I looked. But I am not going to hide behind closed doors anymore. \r\n\r\nI have love and pride in my heart and no matter what I look like on the outside, am going to focus on my education and my future, because that is what is really important. \r\n\r\n**What is puberty?
