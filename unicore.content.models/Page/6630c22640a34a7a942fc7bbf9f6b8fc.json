Portia\u2019s story shows how.* \r\n\r\nIt was her mother-in-law who led Portia into her first business idea. She\u2019d had her first child and was looking for something to help with reducing her stretchmarks. Nothing she\u2019d tried was working. Her mother-in-law recommended marula oil \u2013 an oil from the popular fruit found in many parts of South and West Africa \u2013 as it was what she used when she was younger.\r\n\r\nPortia tried it and was astonished by the results. It worked better than anything she had tried before. And way better than she had expected. She shared on Facebook how it had improved her skin tone and the appearance of her stretchmarks in a huge way. The feedback from all her friends was amazing, especially when they began asking where they could get it too.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s when Portia went to work researching what was so special about the oil. She began bottling the oil from her kitchen and selling it to her friends. They loved it and kept coming back for more. Portia knew it was small-scale and wouldn\u2019t make her the money she wanted. She got advice from her uncle who worked in the factories \u2013 she was interested in adding a body cream too, so she could sell in stores. Before Portia could do that she had to have the products tested and approved by the national board.\r\n\r\nPortia sent her samples to the national board and got the answer she hoped for. After knocking on many doors across town one wholesale store agreed to sell her products. Word has continued to spread and things are going so well that Portia now plans to expand to haircare products soon.\r\n\r\n**What surprising thing have you learnt from an elder in your life that has benefitted you?**\r\n",
