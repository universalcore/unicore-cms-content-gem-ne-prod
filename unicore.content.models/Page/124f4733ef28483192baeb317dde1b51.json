  "content": "Being confident in school can be so hard. I\u2019m always nervous to ask teachers to repeat something I didn\u2019t understand or even raise my hand when I know the right answer to a question. My friends have even noticed, they say I\u2019m so nervous that most people might not realise that I\u2019m actually really smart! But I know I am and could do better at school, I just wish more people could see that. \r\n\r\nMy best friend Anna is super confident. She asks questions even from our toughest teachers \u2013 it\u2019s like nothing scares her! I\u2019m not as confident as she is, but she reminds me that \u201casking questions doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re stupid, you just want to understand something better. Rather ask now than be confused for weeks to come!\u201d\r\n\r\nI know that getting good grades in school means I can have even more choices when I leave school. It will help me study further or even do better at my job if I start working straight away. Anna has so much great advice but her top three tips on doing well at school really helped me \u2013 and they could help you too.\r\n\r\n1.     Ask questions sooner than later.\r\n2.     Stay behind after class and talk to teachers one-on-one if you\u2019re really nervous to speak in front of the whole class. Always ask a friend to stay with you so you\u2019re not alone.  \r\n3.      Don\u2019t pay attention to people who tease you for wanting to do well at school \u2013 stay focused on your end goal and don\u2019t let negative thoughts (especially from others) distract you.\r\n\r\nBut the most important secret Anna has shared with me? She said \u201cRemember, everyone\u2019s afraid of getting judged \u2013 even me! Being brave and asking a question doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not scared.\u201d\r\n \r\nRead more about girls who learnt to speak out and how it changed their communities. \r\n  \r\n",
