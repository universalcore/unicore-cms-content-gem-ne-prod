Drinking too much alcohol too quickly can also lead to alcohol poisoning, which can kill you.\r\n\r\n2 \u2013 Myth: the only thing that helps the body get rid of alcohol is time! Sleep doesn\u2019t help, and drinking alcohol affects the amount of dream sleep you get so you will most likely wake up feeling super groggy in the morning. Alcohol in large amounts is harmful to your body, and your liver (the largest organ in your body) works hard to convert it into a harmless substance. When you constantly drink a lot of alcohol, you will eventually damage your liver.\r\n\r\n3 \u2013 Fact: the substances found in alcohol and drugs are like poison to a developing baby. They can stunt its growth and development causing the baby to have abnormal features, brain damage and learning problems. \r\n\r\n4 \u2013 Fact: coffee will have no effect on sobering a drunk person up, no matter what you\u2019ve heard! Your body needs time (at least eight hours) to burn off the alcohol in your system and the only thing coffee will do is make you feel a little more energised. \r\n\r\n5 \u2013 Myth: drinking alcohol actually causes memory loss, it also makes you slur when you speak and affects your coordination.\r\n\r\n6 \u2013 Myth: most drugs alter the way your brain works, and not in a good way. They make you paranoid, aggressive and they cause hallucinations. Don\u2019t confuse this with creativity. There are many drugs out there, like ecstasy, cocaine, heroin, LSD, marijuana\u2026 the list goes on. Never eat, drink or take any substance you\u2019re not sure of especially if you can see it\u2019s affecting the behaviour of others. Drugs can make you very sick even if it\u2019s the first time you\u2019re taking them \u2013 you could even die.\r\n\r\n7 \u2013 Fact: when the effects of a drug wear off, it\u2019s called \u2018crashing\u2019 and it\u2019s followed by a feeling of deep depression and wanting more of the drug, you may even lose control and start doing horrible things because you want the drug very badly. This is called addiction and can happen even if you\u2019ve taken a drug just once. \r\n\r\n8 \u2013 Fact: marijuana also makes your heart beat a lot faster and you may get panic attacks! Who wants that?",
