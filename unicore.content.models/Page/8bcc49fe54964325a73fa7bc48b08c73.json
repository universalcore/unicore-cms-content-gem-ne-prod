This is all very normal \u2013 it\u2019s called puberty and it means that you\u2019re turning from a girl into a woman. \r\n\r\nPuberty? Tell me more\u2026 \r\nEveryone is different, but one thing we all have in common \u2013 both boys and girls \u2013 is that we go through puberty. It is a time in your life that shows you\u2019re growing up into an adult. You could start puberty as young as 7 or 8 years old and it will last for up to four or five years, but no matter what age you start, we all eventually go through it. \r\n\r\nThe Change Stage\r\nMany things will start to happen with your body, here\u2019s what you need to know\u2026 \r\n\r\nYour breasts will start to grow \r\nYou will get taller \r\nYour skin and hair may become oilier \r\nYour body will fill out and you may get curvier \r\nYou may start to get a few pimples\r\nYou\u2019ll grow hair under your arms and around your vagina (pubic hair)\r\nYou\u2019ll get your period \r\n\r\nAll About Your Period \r\nWhen you hit puberty, one of the most important changes in a girl\u2019s body is when you start your menstrual cycle (your period). This is when you bleed from your vagina for about three to five days. You\u2019ll get your period once a month, and your body prepares for it every day until you start to bleed again. Once you start menstruating, it means your body is also able to fall pregnant and have a baby. \r\n\r\nPuberty can be scary and exciting at the same time, but remember every woman goes through it so know you\u2019re not alone! \r\n\r\nLearn more about what happens inside your body when you\u2019re on your period click here\r\n",
