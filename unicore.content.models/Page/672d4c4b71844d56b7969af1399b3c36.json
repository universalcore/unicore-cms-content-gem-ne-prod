  "content": "It\u2019s hard to say no to spending when my friend Neha always has money for a yummy after-school snack or when the perfect scarf I have had my eye on is now at a reduced price. And even when I\u2019ve promised myself I\u2019ll save, I always end up reaching for my purse\u2026\r\n\r\nWhile there\u2019s nothing wrong with spoiling yourself every now and then, it\u2019s also important to understand that getting something small now may mean you miss out on something even better later. So how do you know what\u2019s worth spending on? \r\n\r\nNeed it or just got to have it? It may feel like those fancy shoes are a must-have (especially when you have a special occasion coming up!) but do you really need them? Needs are the things you can\u2019t do without \u2013 healthy food, shoes for school, medicine when you have a cold. Wants, well, they\u2019re just that! They\u2019re things you\u2019d like to have but can survive without.\r\n\r\nNeha always calls her fashion buys \u2013 like her new earrings \u2013 an investment. But, are they really? Neha\u2019s earrings look good today but may only last her a few months. A good investment is something that will last years or benefit you for many months to come. So instead of buying something that\u2019s hot this season but won\u2019t be hot next season, Neha may be better off saving that money so she can buy shoes for school next year. Needs don\u2019t always have to be boring or serious \u2013 they can be fun things too \u2013 like money to take that computer course at the community centre in town!\r\n\r\nThe best kinds of investments are things that can change your life \u2013 a sewing machine so you can start earning your own money or tuition to study further. These are the things that you\u2019ll probably have to save for. That means saying no to a pretty scarf today, but it will be worth the wait, and you will be super proud of yourself when you can finally cash in and get your big dream!\r\nWant to start saving? Here are a few tips to get you started :\r\n",
