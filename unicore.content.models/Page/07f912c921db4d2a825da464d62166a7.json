  "content": "Not all jobs may require a resume or a CV, but some employers and job postings will ask for one, so it is good to know how to compile one.  \r\nAnd just because you don't have any work experience, don't let that keep you from applying for those jobs. There are things you can put in your resume to help improve your chances of getting noticed. \r\n\r\nRemember these seven tips:\r\n\r\n1. Keep it simple: \r\nThere is no need to use fancy words, fonts, designs or pictures. Use plain, white paper and black ink. If you can get your resume typed, do it. If you don\u2019t know how to use a computer, go to an internet caf\u00e9 or ask a friend to help you. It\u2019s also fine if it\u2019s handwritten, just make it\u2019s neat and there are no mistakes. \r\n\r\n2. Be accurate and up-to-date: \r\nMake sure your contact information is correct. Include a phone number (and an email address if you have one and are able to check it regularly). Resumes are all about first impressions, so make sure your email address is professional \u2013 duckface@hotmail.com \u2013 for example, is not a good way to present yourself to a future boss. If you need to change or create a new one, use something simple like your full name, a middle name or your initials and last name.\r\n\r\n3. Introduce yourself: \r\nInclude a few lines at the top of your page telling the employer who you are and about your strongest skills and best personality traits. If you are applying for many types of jobs, take the time to tailor this to highlight skills that are most applicable to the specific job you\u2019re applying for.\r\n\r\n4. Don\u2019t make up work experience if you don\u2019t have it: \r\nFocus on things you have done, like volunteer work, community activities, clubs you\u2019ve belonged to. If you\u2019ve done work experience through a course at school include it. If you\u2019ve had odd jobs, or done things like sell goods at the market or yard work for neighbours, list it. If you can, get a reference letter from someone you have worked for that speaks about your reliable character.\r\n\r\n5. List the school subjects and courses you\u2019ve done: \r\nPut the ones that are most relevant to the job at the top. Make note of any academic achievements or awards. Explain how your performance in these areas would be good for the job. A reference letter from a teacher would be helpful.\r\n\r\n6. Include clubs, committees, sports and after school activities: These show you\u2019re a team player, and if you have a position like captain, treasurer or secretary in your sports\u2019 or religious clubs, note them and describe your duties and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nBe smart. Don\u2019t give up on getting that dream job and good luck!\r\nHave you gotten a call back after submitting a resume? Do you have an interview? Learn what to say and do so you can secure that job!\r\n",
