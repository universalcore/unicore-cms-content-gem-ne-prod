Even if you can\u2019t go out and get a job, think about the things that you\u2019re really great at and get ready to get paid!\r\n\r\n**Deka\u2019s Delicious Opportunity**\r\n\r\nAre you super\u2010smart in the kitchen? Do your friends somehow always show up when they know you\u2019re the one cooking? Start selling your homemade dishes or snacks at school.\r\nDeka is 13 and she\u2019s been helping her mom cook since she was tiny. \u201cWhenever I need extra money, I make our traditional steam cakes and sell them to my friends after school. I sell them for less than the ones at the store next to the school, and they\u2019re fresh so people like them better.\u201d\r\n\r\n**Tawa Teaches Someone a Lesson**\r\n\r\nTawa is only 16, but she\u2019s already a teacher because she gives lessons after school to three younger girls that live near her house. She started casually, just offering assistance for free when the neighborhood kids would ask her, but some of the parents were so happy with how fast their daughters were learning that they paid her to help their kids with homework twice a week. Tawa says, \u201cIf you share all the things you\u2019ve learnt from studying, the good will come back to you. I get some money to spend on the things that I want, and I feel good because I know I\u2019m helping someone else to learn, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n**Wadida\u2019s Work of Art**\r\n\r\nWadida is 18 now, but she started designing logos and posters for businesses in her neighborhood when she was only 15. \u201cIf you\u2019re more into art, some people will tell you that you need to focus on things that are more practical,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, who do you think makes all of the art that businesses need? They don\u2019t happen by magic, they are made by people drawing them!\u201d\r\n\r\nWadida started off by making drawings and computer art for business cards for her aunt\u2019s hair braiding business. Her aunt was so impressed that she recommended Wadida to two of her other friends who had small businesses. Soon, Wadida had customers all over her town and now she is studying graphic design at college.\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s your talent or skill? Maybe it can earn you money.** \r\n",
