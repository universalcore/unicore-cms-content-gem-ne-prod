  "content": "1. Speak Up in Class\r\nRaise your hand, even when you\u2019re not sure about the answer. Avoid editing what you want to say in your head, and try not to worry about being wrong. Speaking up isn\u2019t about having the perfect answer. It gives you the experience of thinking on your feet, debating with others, and wrestling with an idea \u2013 all crucial skills that you\u2019ll use in every area of your life.\r\n\r\n2. Stop Apologizing Before You Speak\r\nGirls often introduce opinions with apologies (\u201cI\u2019m not sure if this is right, but...\u201d). Pay attention to the little ways you might be making yourself smaller when you speak up in class, like playing with your hair, saying you \u201ckind of\u201d think something, asking if what you just said \u201cmakes sense,\u201d or speaking so softly that no one can hear you.\r\n\r\n3. Challenge Yourself\r\nWhen we worry about failure or criticism, we\u2019re more likely to seek out experiences we know we can control. But playing it safe means you\u2019ll never have the exhilaration of overcoming an obstacle and proving to yourself (and others) that you\u2019re brave enough to try. Push yourself beyond your comfort zone. Take up a sport you\u2019ve never played. Enroll in a class that no one would expect you to take. Learn how to code. Or take a small risk, like introducing yourself to someone you don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\n4. Ask for Help\r\nThe most successful people don\u2019t make it on their own. Instead, they find advisors along the way: experienced, wiser people who know a lot and help them. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask teachers, coaches, or other adults you admire to talk with you about what you\u2019re passionate about. Ask them what they wish they\u2019d known when they were your age. Who knows, one day they may even help make your dreams a reality!\r\n\r\n5. Don\u2019t Do Everyone Else\u2019s Work\r\nWhen a group project member doesn\u2019t contribute well (or at all), it\u2019s easy just to do it yourself \u2013 and stay quiet about it. Taking over can give you control in the moment, but it can also leave you feeling resentful, carrying more of the workload, and not getting any of the credit. Address the problem directly by asking your classmate when she thinks she\u2019ll finish her tasks. If you don\u2019t get a clear response, be more direct about what you need, or ask a teacher for help.\r\n6. Speak Up in Friendship\r\nWe\u2019ve probably all gossiped at one point or another, but if you always talk about your friends instead of to them, you miss the chance to practice speaking up to the people who matter most. Being able to tell someone how you feel will help you in every area\r\nof your life, no matter how you choose to lean in. And you may want to avoid relying on texting or social media to say the tough stuff. It makes communication easier in the moment, but you\u2019ll risk paying the price later of not speaking face-to-face now. Being direct is scary, but do it with care and you\u2019ll earn the respect and trust of those around you.\r\n\r\n7. Trust Your Inner Voice\r\nWe all have a voice playing inside our heads. It might say little things like \u201cI wish the bell would ring\u201d or big things like \u201cI wish my friend would stop asking me about my grades.\u201d That voice is your gut. It\u2019s telling you what you genuinely think, need and want. It\u2019s easy to stop listening to that voice when you\u2019re worried about what people might think. Stay connected to it as much as you can. It\u2019s your inner compass. If you can\u2019t share that voice now, keep a journal where you can \u2013 and keep looking for the people who want to hear it.\r\n\r\n8. Change the World\r\nYou don\u2019t have to run the world to change it. What lights you up inside? What makes you feel outraged? Join a club or start a community organisation. Maybe even vote YOU for class president. Running a campaign gives you amazing practice for speaking and marketing yourself as a leader. Whatever you decide, remember: your voice is like no one else\u2019s, but we won\u2019t hear it if you don\u2019t use it.\r\n\r\n9. Remember: It\u2019s Not Always Easy to Speak Up, but It\u2019s Worth It\r\nYou\u2019re growing up in a world that\u2019s still confused about how powerful it wants girls to be. Girls are supposed to be confident but nice, ambitious but not selfish, successful but not conceited. The rules can be confusing and unfair \u2013 which means not everyone\u2019s going to love it when you speak up. In fact, no matter how nicely you say something, there may be a person who thinks you\u2019re being mean. Trust your voice even when it feels like the world doesn\u2019t, and stay close to the friends and family members who celebrate your strength.\r\n10. Practice!\r\nYou\u2019ve grown up practicing things like schoolwork, sports, and music. But no one tells you to practice speaking up, taking risks, or saying what you need. What\u2019s up with that? There\u2019s nothing in life that doesn\u2019t require practice, and speaking up is no exception. Work those muscles! It might be scary the first time, but it gets easier.\r\n \r\n Tips courtesy [http://banbossy.com][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://banbossy.com",
