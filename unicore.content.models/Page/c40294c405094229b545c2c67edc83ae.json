  "content": "Do you struggle to concentrate at school? Or find your eyelids get heavier and heavier and before you know it, the teacher is asking you to wake up? Maybe it\u2019s time to make some changes to some of your daily habits so you can get the most out of your school day!\r\n\r\nBrain breakfast\r\nOf course you want to sleep for five more minutes, but breakfast is worth more than a few extra minutes of sleep. For you to have the best start to your day, you need a breakfast full of nutrients that will give you energy. Think porridge, cereal or whole-grain/brown bread with peanut butter, some milk and a piece of fruit. A good breakfast will ensure that you are sitting up and listening in class. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t be thirsty\r\nYour body needs clean water to be able to feed your brain cells. If you don\u2019t drink enough water you\u2019ll become tired and unable to learn. Not great if you want to be top of the class! Stay away from sodas or other sweet drinks and stay hydrated with water \u2013 find a big plastic bottle, which you can keep filling up. Your brain will thank you.\r\n\r\nRemember this\r\nA good memory is important if you want to learn. The best way to feed your memory is with a nutrient called iron. You find the most iron in red meat, whole-grain/brown bread, beans, spinach and nuts. If you want to have the best memory in class, make sure you eat these foods. \r\n\r\nFish is key\r\nMany types of fish have oils that are very important for brain growth. These oils make sure that your brain cells carry memory messages. You should try to eat fish at least twice a week. If you don\u2019t like it or there is no access to fresh fish where you live, tinned fish is also yummy and healthy. Otherwise you can also get the same memory boosters in milk, cheese and eggs. \r\n",
