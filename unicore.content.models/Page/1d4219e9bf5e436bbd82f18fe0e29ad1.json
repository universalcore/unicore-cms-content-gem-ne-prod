  "content": "They say money makes money \u2013 but there are some ways you can get around this when you\u2019re looking to start a business with little or no money.\r\n\r\nHere are five things to consider:\r\n\r\n**1. Borrow from family:** \r\nChances are there is someone in your family who has the means to lend you the money you need. It could be a parent, a sibling or another relative. The perks in this scenario are that you can usually negotiate when you pay them back \u2013 plus you won\u2019t likely be charged interest. Just be careful that you do pay the cash back because you don\u2019t want to ruin a relationship. \r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Save, save, save:** \r\nDon\u2019t have enough money yet to get started? Be patient!  Putting away a little money every month or week is the best way to start a business \u2013 that way you don\u2019t owe anyone. And all the money you make you can keep or use it to grow your business.\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. De-clutter to make money:** \r\nGot clothes that you\u2019re not wearing anymore, books you\u2019ve read but can live without? Host a little sale and sell to friends and neighbours. If you don\u2019t have stuff to sell, ask your mom, dad or a local business owner if you can clean up their cluttered storage space \u2013 like a storeroom or pantry. If you find anything that\u2019s still usable and that they no longer want or need, ask if you can sell it. Hello easy cash!\r\n\r\n\r\n**4. Get it for free:** \r\nIs there a rent-free space you could borrow from a family member or friend? Ask your siblings to help you with things, and in return you do their chores. If you don\u2019t have supplies or equipment, think of something you could barter. A basket of wild spinach you picked could equal an hour using a neighbour\u2019s sewing machine. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask \u2013 all they can say is no. \r\n\r\n\r\n**5. Use word of mouth:** \r\nYour friends and family are a great, free way to spread the word about your products or service. Ask your friends to post about your business on social media. Give family members small samples of your product or a free service, tell them to share and to tell all their friends and family. \r\n\r\n**You don\u2019t need lots of cash to start a business. Be creative, think of new ways to save money. That way you can spend the money you make (no matter how little) for the things you absolutely can\u2019t do without.  That\u2019s the stuff that makes your product or service great!**  \r\n",
