It is a natural part of growing up and it doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing.\r\n\r\nCut the cramping\r\nIf you get stomach cramps before or during your period, you\u2019re not alone. Most girls will get stomach cramps and back pains, it\u2019s because the muscles in your uterus (your womb) are moving to release the lining. And you may think that you shouldn\u2019t go out, do sport or play with your friends when you have your period \u2013 not true! Exercise is a great way to get the muscles moving and heal cramps. Make sure to use a sanitary towel or a clean cloth to catch the blood and change it regularly to keep germs that could make you sick away.  \r\nAnother way to ease the pain is to take a warm bath, or you can wrap a bottle of hot water in a towel and put it on your stomach. The good news is the cramps shouldn\u2019t last longer than a day or two.\r\n\r\nMood swings\r\nDid you cry over something your mom or dad said even though it wasn\u2019t that bad? Did you start an argument with your best friend but you\u2019re not really sure why? Totally normal! The hormones \u2013 little messengers in your bloodstream that send chemical reactions to different parts of your body \u2013 are in charge of the menstrual cycle and are the ones to blame. Depending on what they\u2019re up to, the levels can change a lot which is why you may feel a little sensitive or emotional sometimes. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you it\u2019s all natural but if you\u2019re aware of it, it\u2019s easier to control. \r\n\r\nAcne attack\r\nYou will probably notice that a few days before your period starts, pimples will suddenly pop up on your face even if you\u2019re not normally very spotty \u2013 again you can blame your hormones. Drink lots of water, it will flush out your system which will help your body fight pimple causing germs. And stay away from oily food, fizzy drinks and sweets, they\u2019re a pimple\u2019s best friend. \r\n\r\nHow to know if something is wrong \r\nCramps, mood swings and pimples are all normal symptoms that are part of getting your period. But some things are not. If your body is showing any of these signs, you may need to see a doctor, a health worker or go to the local clinic:\r\n \r\n- You haven\u2019t gotten your period for a few months \r\n- Your period is lasting longer than seven days \r\n- If you are bleeding very heavily and it\u2019s not getting lighter as the week goes on.\r\n- Your cramps are so bad that you can hardly move \r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing any of the above, don\u2019t be quiet! Tell your parents, an older sibling or an adult you trust immediately so you can get help. \r\nFor health services in your area click here <link to GET HELP>",
