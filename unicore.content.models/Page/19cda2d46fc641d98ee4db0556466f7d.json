  "content": "Did you know that getting an education has been proven to help girls (just like you!) live better lives? And it\u2019s not just important for girls, it\u2019s also important for the whole community. Experts have even studied this and say that when girls are able to complete primary and secondary school, they\u2019re more likely to make smarter and healthier choices about protecting themselves from diseases, as well as things like when they will marry and how many children to have. It\u2019s also been shown that educating girls helps a country\u2019s economy because educated girls get better jobs, earn more and help their families out of poverty and even create more jobs! \r\n\r\nThis is why many governments and worldwide organisations like the United Nations support girls\u2019 education. But it\u2019s not just big organisations, governments and adults who think that educating girls is awesome, here\u2019s what girls like you from around the world had to say\u2026 \r\n \r\nDanvi (18), who lives in Bangladesh, says. \u201cI\u2019m one of millions of girls who\u2019ve been helped by the Bangladesh Female Secondary School Assistance Program. As the youngest of seven children, I didn\u2019t think I could go to school \u2013 it was just too expensive. But the Program helped pay my fees and I\u2019ll finish school this year. The program has also helped build better schools and at my school, they\u2019ve even provided separate bathrooms for boys and girls, which some schools in my area don\u2019t have.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere in Liberia, the Children\u2019s Law of Liberia was signed into law in 2012,\u201d says Miata (14). \u201cThe law is based on the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, which aims to protect all children \u2013 and promote their right to education! Unlike my mother, I\u2019ll now have the chance to have a good education as the law aims to make schools and teachers better. Plus, they\u2019re going to introduce free, compulsory primary education for all children.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI live in Mendoza, Argentina,\u201d says 12-year-old Sofa. \u201cHere, if you go to a government school, you can study all the way up to an undergraduate degree in university \u2013 for free! This means that my parents don\u2019t have to worry about whether they can afford to pay for me to finish school. Even if I don\u2019t go to university, having finished my schooling is going to make a big difference in the kinds of jobs I can get.\u201d \r\n\r\nYou too deserve and can get a good education! \r\n",
