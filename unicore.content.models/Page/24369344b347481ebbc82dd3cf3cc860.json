  "content": "When you have money, it can be so easy to spend it! Especially when there\u2019s something you\u2019ve wanted for a long time \u2013 like material to sew a new skirt or a novel by your favourite author. Buying yourself a treat sometimes isn\u2019t a bad thing, but saving for your future is very important.\r\n\r\nSaving even a little bit whenever you get money is a way to do something great for your future self. But it\u2019s not always easy, so here\u2019s how to start:\r\n\r\nWork out how much money you need right now \u2013 if you have to buy school books or another necessity, like medicine, spending is okay. From there, you can set aside a little bit of money to treat yourself with something small \u2013 maybe a wonderful new soap. The rest is what you should save. How much is enough? Try put away at least half of what you have.\r\n\r\nSpeak to your parents or a trusted adult like an aunt about opening an account with a bank or a local savings group. Some savings groups may let you open your own account but others might only let an adult open an account for you. The great thing about putting your money away like this is that it will be more effort for you to get to it \u2013 and spend it!\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re not able to get to a bank, use an old jar, tin or box with a lock to put your money in so it\u2019s out of your purse. Ask your parents to keep the jar for you or store it in a safe place where you can\u2019t easily get to it \u2013 this will make it easier for you not to spend!\r\n\r\nSaving is important for your future \u2013 and it\u2019s a good habit to get into now. A lot of the big things you might want in life \u2013 like studying, opening a business, even getting married or buying a house one day \u2013 can cost a lot. By learning how to put money aside now, it will be easier to afford a big life expense when it comes along later!\r\n",
