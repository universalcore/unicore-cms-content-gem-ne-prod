  "content": "Every girl has the right to learn and should have access to schools that are close by, and safe to attend. We\u2019ve rounded up a few well-known people who totally agree with us (and you!) about this. Let their words inspire you stay in school as long as you can because it will better your future.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe cannot succeed when half of us are held back. We call upon our sisters around the world to be brave, to embrace the strength within themselves and realise their full potential.\u201d \u2013 **Malala Yousafzai, an activist for girl\u2019s education from Pakistan and the youngest-ever Nobel Prize winner**\r\n \r\n\u201cLive as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.\u201d **\u2013 Mahatma Gandhi, a leader of the Indian independence movement**\r\n \r\n\u201cEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.\u201d \u2013 **Former South African president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela**\r\n \r\n\u201cEducate a boy and you educate an individual. Educate a girl and you educate a community.\u201d **\u2013 African Proverb**\r\n\r\n\u201cGive a girl an education, introduce her properly to the world and ten to one she will have the means of settling well and without further expense to anybody.\u201d **\u2013 English writer Jane Austen** \r\n \r\n\u201cGirls have to be taught from early that they are strong and capable of being anything they want to be. It\u2019s up to us to change the statistics for women around the world \u2026 and set an example for the next generation of young ladies.\u201d **\u2013 American musician and humanitarian ambassador Beyonc\u00e9**\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen girls are educated their countries become stronger and more prosperous.\u201d **\u2013 Wife of the American president, Michelle Obama**\r\n \r\n\u201cWe are the change that we seek. Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time.\u201d **\u2013 Bipasha Basu, Indian film actress**\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen women and adolescent girls have equal rights and opportunities, their families, communities and nations prosper.\u201d **\u2013 Dr Babatunde Osotimehin, Nigerian public health expert and executive at the United Nations**\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that when you educate a girl, you empower a nation.\u201d **\u2013 Queen Rania of Jordan**\r\n\r\n\u201cThe world will never realise 100% of its goals if 50% of its people cannot realise their full potential. When we unleash the power of women, we can secure the future for all.\u201d **\u2013 UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon**\r\n \r\n",
