  "content": "*Modeling is a respectable profession for girls in many countries. This is the story of one girl.* \n\nMy name is Aurore and I live in Rwanda. Since I was 13, I\u2019ve liked watching\nmodels work. I used to follow my older sister and watch her make-believe model\nand I fell in love with what I saw: strong, beautiful and confident women\ncelebrating their inner and outer beauty. When I turned 17, I also began\nmodeling for fun. But I quickly noticed that people didn\u2019t pay attention to\nme. The bosses were mean. The models were treated as things, not people.\n\nOne day after watching my friend being yelled at again, I had an idea: I could\ndo a better job than these bosses! I should own and run a modeling agency\nwhere I would make sure the models were treated with respect! As time went by\nI started really believing in my idea. I closely watched how things worked and\nhow modeling agencies were run. I knew I had to work very hard to make it\nhappen. I asked people with business experience for advice. I talked to other\nyoung people and models about my dream. Everybody encouraged me! My parents\nsupported me too. They always said I could make my dreams come true if I tried\nhard enough. I\u2019ve been so thankful for them. Then in July 2011, I took a big\nstep and decided to start my own business. By November that year, I launched\nmy own company, the Ikobe Modelling Company! This was an exciting but scary\ntime. Looking back, I am so proud that I was brave enough to work hard and\nfollow my dreams. Today, my business continues to grow and I can support\nmyself with my own money. But what is really great is that I\u2019ve been able to\nhire other young people so they can support themselves too. Together we are\nworking to develop Rwanda\u2019s economy, and we\u2019re doing it with pride and\ndignity. Girls, no matter what your dreams are, always remember to work hard,\nvalue other people, respect yourself and go for your dreams! I wake up happy\nevery morning knowing I am working to make a better future.\n\n",
