We hope their words and actions inspire you to want to make your town, village, school and home better.\r\n\r\n\"Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another stepping stone to greatness.\" \u2013 Oprah Winfrey\r\nBorn to a single mother in rural Mississippi in the United States, Oprah Winfrey had a difficult childhood. But she didn\u2019t let poverty stop her. She worked her way up, achieving one small milestone after another until she became the host of her own TV show, The Oprah Winfrey Show. It went on to become one of the most popular talk shows in the history of television.

And we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's the little things citizens do. That's what will make the difference. My little thing is planting trees.\u201d \u2013 Wangari Maathai\r\nWangari Maathai is a Kenyan environmental activist who was born in a rural village and went on to become the first African woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, in 2004.
