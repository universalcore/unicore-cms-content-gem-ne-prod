  "content": "Recently, my best friend Habiba and I have been talking about our plans for our future. Habiba wants to be a teacher and I\u2019ve been thinking about studying to be a nurse. Problem is, studying is so expensive! So we decided to start saving for our studies together and it\u2019s been awesome because: \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re responsible for each other. We decided to save together because we trust each other \u2013 a lot! At the beginning, we told each other our goals and wrote them down in our own notebooks. Every time we put some money away, we write down how much and on what date in our notebooks. It helps us see how much progress we\u2019ve made and makes it easier to update one another \u2013 something we agreed to do every two weeks. \r\n\r\nWe help each other say no. Having someone else saving with me means that when we\u2019re out with our friends and they want to spend money on a treat, it\u2019s easier to say no because I have Habiba to back me up. Even if she isn\u2019t there, I know I\u2019ll have to tell her later, which discourages me from spending too much. \r\n\r\nWe plan low-cost rewards. We\u2019ve both set ourselves small goals for how much we\u2019d like to save every month. When we reach a goal, we get to have a small treat \u2013 like a delicious sweet cake.\r\n\r\nWe encourage each other. Whenever I feel like my goal is impossible and I should just give up, I can talk to Habiba and she\u2019ll encourage me to keep going. It helps to save with someone else, we support each other when it feels like we\u2019ll never save enough or it feels like we\u2019re going off track! \r\n\r\nWe help each other out. When Habiba had to attend a wedding a few weekends ago, she knew she needed a new dress, but didn\u2019t want to use her savings. Instead, she borrowed a dress from me. By helping each other out \u2013 sharing clothes and sometimes even a school lunch \u2013 we\u2019re able to put more money aside. \r\n\r\nLearn more about saving and how to start your own saving book here <link to Your guide to saving > ",
