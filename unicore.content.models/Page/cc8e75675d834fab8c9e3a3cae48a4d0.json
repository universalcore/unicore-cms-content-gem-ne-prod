Not perfect\u2026 ooooh, not even close to perfect. \r\n\r\nFirst thing: know this, you\u2019re not the only one feeling this way \u2013 many girls struggle with confidence. Secondly: stop! \r\n\r\nNo seriously, stop those thoughts about yourself right now. \r\n\r\nWe are our own worst enemies. We judge ourselves way too harshly. We say and think things about ourselves that we would never say or think about our friends or even our worst, most bitter, most hated enemies. \r\n\r\nWe all need a break and should start learning to love ourselves. The good news? We can start right now. Take this first step. Look into the mirror and see a beautiful girl with a beautiful mind and heart there. Guess who? It\u2019s you.\r\n\r\nSay it! Three simple words: \u201cI am beautiful.\u201d\r\n\r\nThen say it again. Then shout it. Nevermind your mom and siblings who are asking why you\u2019ve gone crazy, keep yelling it. You need to believe it, because it is true. Beautiful doesn\u2019t mean what you see in a magazine or on television or somebody else's opinion that you are trying to live up to. It isn\u2019t just about what is on the outside, it\u2019s also about what\u2019s on the inside. \r\n\r\nSay it again: \u201cI am beautiful!\u201d\r\n\r\nBecause you are beautiful. You\u2019re not perfect, nobody is. But you can be confident. You can be sure of who you are. You can decide who you are, and how you feel and react to the world. So it\u2019s in your power, you can build your whole life around three little words:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am beautiful!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd once you know that in your heart, everything gets easier. You don\u2019t have to waste another minute on negative thoughts. Focus your energy into your passions and planning your amazing future! \r\n\r\nHow do you find your passion? Follow our tips here",
