  "content": "The idea of the Girl Effect started 10 years ago when a group of people\nstarted noticing that adolescent girls were doing some pretty amazing things\naround the world. They watched and listened to what girls were doing and they\nrealised that, when given the chance, the girl is actually the most powerful\nforce for change on the planet - and they wanted others to know this too. More\npeople, including powerful people, started understanding that girls really do\nhave a special spark and could even end poverty for themselves, their\nfamilies, their communities and ultimately for the world. As more people\nbecame aware of the power of girls, a movement started and this became known\nas the Girl Effect. Today even more people are joining the Girl Effect, and we\nhope you can join us too.\n\n",
