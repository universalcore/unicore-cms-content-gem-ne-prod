  "content": "No one is born to be poor, because no matter how little money you start with you can learn how to manage it so it grows! Good news is that it is a skill that can be learnt \u2013 and the earlier you learn it, the more you can practice it and the longer you practice it, the better you get at it. So get started now, here\u2019s how\u2026  \r\n\r\n**Sell it:** \r\nIf you don\u2019t need it anymore, sell it. Books, toys, DVDs, CDs, clothes, furniture \u2013 anything you have that you haven\u2019t used in the past year probably means you can live without it.\r\n\r\n**Make cash on the side:** \r\nUse your skills and talents. Whether it\u2019s giving extra lessons to students at your school, coaching a sport like chess, sewing clothes or fixing things in your neighbours\u2019 homes. Ways to make some extra money are everywhere, so always be on the lookout. But be careful, people may look to take advantage of a girl looking to earn extra money. Trust your instincts, if an opportunity feels wrong or too good to be true it probably is. \r\n\r\n**Shop around:** \r\nNever buy things or take out services (especially expensive ones) at the first shop you go to. Compare prices at different stores or with different suppliers. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for a discount or about benefits like student discounts \u2013 if you have a college student card you may be able to save on many products. \r\n\r\n**Don\u2019t overspend:** \r\nMaking extra money doesn\u2019t give you license to spend it the first chance you get. Any extra money left over from paying important expenses should go straight into a savings bank account. If you are too young or unable to open a bank account use a box or container with a lock to store your money and make sure to keep it somewhere safe. \r\n\r\nCheck out more saving tricks here\r\n",
