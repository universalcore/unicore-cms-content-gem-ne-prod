Keen to start a business but you just can\u2019t think of that great idea? Want to get married, just not yet?\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re feeling powerless and think there is nothing you can do\u2026 think again! \r\n \r\nPowerless people have one thing in common: \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d is a word they use \u2013 often. Sometimes they use it so often it becomes second nature. \r\n\r\nYou may face struggles that feel too big or deal with people or situations that stand in the way of what you want. Using the word \u201ccan\u2019t\u201c \u2013 even in these situations \u2013 is like saying that all positivity and creativity stops. It is a declaration that there is no other solution and that nothing can change.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t\u201d is usually a replacement for one of three things. When you say it, what you\u2019re actually trying to say is:\r\n\r\n\u2022 I don\u2019t want to\r\n\r\n\u2022 I don\u2019t know how to (meaning you need help)\r\n\r\n\u2022 I don\u2019t believe I can\r\n\r\nOnce you replace \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d with one of these true meanings you\u2019ll be able to get to the root of your problem, and why you feel powerless. By substituting, \u201cI can\u2019t do this schoolwork\u201d with \u201cI don\u2019t know how\u2026\u201d it will suddenly become clear why you\u2019re not where you want to be. Now you can do something about it.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s fine because that\u2019s your choice.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t know how, you can choose to learn or seek the help and support of others to try overcome your struggle. Some situations are not within your control and some problems you cannot solve on your own. When faced with these it\u2019s important to reach out to others. Find someone you can trust to talk to, this may not solve what you face immediately but it is always a good start. \r\n\r\nThe last of these is the easiest of the three to overcome. If you don\u2019t believe you can all you have to do is change your belief. \r\n\r\nConfidence in yourself doesn\u2019t happen overnight but it can start with small things that make you feel powerful. Like removing the word \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d from your vocabulary today! Get ready to make goals happen \u2013 turn your life around and your dreams into possibilities.\r\n",
